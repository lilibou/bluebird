# `bluebird`

the vision:
- monitor tweets about crypto in real-time, classifying them by positive/negative
- compares the recorded sentiment against the performance of a coin
- bluebird rates twitter users' ability to predict the market, and uses this to (attempt) to make predictions in real-time

Plan:
- add flag to let the user scrape tweets between two given dates, and save them as csv
- write code to classify whether tweets are predicting the coin is going up or going down
- collect data for the price of the coin over the same time period
- graph the accuract of users' predictions vs what actually happened
